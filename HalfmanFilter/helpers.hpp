    Normalizes a grid of numbers. 

    @param grid - a two dimensional grid (vector of vectors of floats)
		   where each entry represents the unnormalized probability 
		   associated with that grid cell.

    @return - a new normalized two dimensional grid where the sum of

/**
	TODO - implement this function.

    Blurs (and normalizes) a grid of probabilities by spreading 
    probability from each cell over a 3x3 "window" of cells. This 
    function assumes a cyclic world where probability "spills 
    over" from the right edge to the left and bottom to top. 

    EXAMPLE - After blurring (with blurring=0.12) a localized 
    distribution like this:

    0.00  0.00  0.00 
    0.00  1.00  0.00
    0.00  0.00  0.00 

    would look like this:
	
	0.01  0.02	0.01
	0.02  0.88	0.02
	0.01  0.02  0.01

    @param grid - a two dimensional grid (vector of vectors of floats)
		   where each entry represents the unnormalized probability 
		   associated with that grid cell.

	@param blurring - a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0 
		   which represents how much probability from one cell 
		   "spills over" to it's neighbors. If it's 0.0, then no
		   blurring occurs. 

    @return - a new normalized two dimensional grid where probability 
    	   has been blurred.
